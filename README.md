Qmachine
========

[Qmachine](http://qmachine.org) is a web service that uses
[Quanah](https://github.com/wilkinson/quanah) to implement a web service that
acts as a "supercomputer" for running scientific computations using only web
browsers and CouchDB. I am currently writing several papers about Quanah and
Qmachine, but I promise I will write more documentation here soon!
