Quanah
======

Quanah is a JavaScript library for writing concurrent programs in JavaScript
that still run correctly in serial execution environments.
[Qmachine](http://qmachine.org), for example, uses Quanah to implement a web
service that acts as a "supercomputer" for running scientific computations
using only web browsers and CouchDB. I am currently writing several papers
about Quanah and applications that use it, but I promise I will write more
documentation here soon!

There are several "mirrors" available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/wilkinson/quanah),
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wilkinson/quanah), and
[Google Code](https://quanah.googlecode.com).
